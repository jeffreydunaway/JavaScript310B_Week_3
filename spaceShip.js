// 1. Create a class function SpaceShip
// - should set two properties: name and topSpeed
// - should have a method accelerate that logs to the console 
//   `${name} moving to ${topSpeed}`

class SpaceShip{

}
topSpeed => 40

// 2. Call the constructor with a couple ships, 
// and call accelerate on both of them.
